# Chapter 1: Learning Objectives
## ROS 2 Basics (Nodes, Topics, Services)

**Generated by**: `learning-objectives` skill
**Date**: 2025-11-30
**Alignment**: Bloom's Taxonomy (Levels 1-3: Remember → Understand → Apply)

---

## Level 1: Remember
*Students will be able to define and list key ROS 2 concepts*

- [ ] **Define a ROS 2 node**
  - What is a node?
  - How does it fit in the ROS 2 graph?
  - Example: `hello_node` publishes "Hello, ROS 2!" every second

- [ ] **List the basic communication patterns in ROS 2**
  - Publication/Subscription (topics)
  - Service Call/Response
  - Actions (mentioned for future)

- [ ] **Recall ROS 2 command-line tools**
  - `ros2 run` (execute a node)
  - `ros2 topic` (interact with topics)
  - `ros2 service` (interact with services)
  - `ros2 node` (get node information)

---

## Level 2: Understand
*Students will be able to explain core concepts and how they interact*

- [ ] **Explain how the ROS 2 graph works**
  - Nodes as independent processes
  - Topics as communication channels
  - Subscribers and publishers
  - Message flow: Publisher → Topic → Subscribers
  - Assessment: Can students draw a simple ROS 2 graph?

- [ ] **Describe pub/sub communication pattern**
  - Why use publish/subscribe?
  - One-to-many communication
  - Decoupled publishers and subscribers
  - Topic names and message types
  - QoS (Quality of Service) settings (introduced but not deep)
  - Assessment: Students explain pub/sub vs client/server

- [ ] **Describe service communication pattern**
  - Request/response synchronous communication
  - When to use services vs topics
  - Service names and interface types
  - Service server (provider) and client (requester)
  - Assessment: Students distinguish services from topics

- [ ] **Explain how rclpy (ROS 2 Python library) works**
  - Node creation and initialization
  - Publisher and subscriber creation
  - Callback functions and event handling
  - Spinning and event loop
  - Assessment: Students trace code execution through rclpy

---

## Level 3: Apply
*Students will be able to use knowledge to create and run ROS 2 programs*

- [ ] **Create a simple ROS 2 publisher node in Python**
  - Use rclpy.Node as base class
  - Create publisher with create_publisher()
  - Use timer to periodically publish messages
  - Implement timer_callback()
  - Run and verify with `ros2 topic echo`
  - Assessment: Exercise 1 - Students create modified hello_node

- [ ] **Create a simple ROS 2 subscriber node in Python**
  - Create subscriber with create_subscription()
  - Implement message callback function
  - Process received messages
  - Run alongside publisher and verify reception
  - Assessment: Exercise 2 - Students create subscriber to echo published messages

- [ ] **Create a ROS 2 service client and server in Python**
  - Implement service server with create_service()
  - Implement service callback to handle requests
  - Create service client with create_client()
  - Send service request and process response
  - Run both and test synchronous communication
  - Assessment: Exercise 3 - Students create simple math service (add two numbers)

- [ ] **Use command-line tools to interact with running ROS 2 systems**
  - List and inspect nodes: `ros2 node list`, `ros2 node info`
  - List and inspect topics: `ros2 topic list`, `ros2 topic info`, `ros2 topic echo`
  - Call services: `ros2 service call`
  - View ROS 2 graph: `rqt_graph`
  - Assessment: Students debug a running system using CLI tools

## Assessment Strategy

| Objective | Assessment Method | Success Criteria |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|
| Define ROS 2 concepts | Quiz/flashcards | 100% recall |
| Explain communication patterns | Short answer essay | Clear, logical explanation |
| Create publisher node | Hands-on exercise | Code builds, runs, publishes correctly |
| Create subscriber node | Hands-on exercise | Receives and logs messages |
| Create service pair | Hands-on exercise | Request/response works, values correct |
| Use CLI tools | Practical debugging task | Correctly diagnoses and troubleshoots |
